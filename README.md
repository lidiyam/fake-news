# Fake News Detection

My solution to a DataCup competition [Leaders Prize: Fact or Fake News?](https://www.defidonnees.com/main/competitions/leadersprize2019/about).

- Classified each claim in the dataset using an encoder with a classification network on top.
- Compared performance of RNN and transformer network encoders for claim classification.

Transformer network implementation based on [How to code the transformer in Pytorch](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-code-the-transformer-in-pytorch-24db27c8f9ec) article.
